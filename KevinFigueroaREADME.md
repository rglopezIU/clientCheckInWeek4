# ClientCheckIn4 Kevin Figueroa
I was responsible for the following concepts: IDE, GitHub. GitHub Pages, GitHub Repository, 
JavaScript, DOM, Developer Tools Console, Syntax, Semantics
I built the CSS and HTML foundation for the group to add to. 
The group communicated well and we all knew the parts we were responsible for. We were all on 
the same page and were tracking eachother's progress on the homework throughout the entire process.
